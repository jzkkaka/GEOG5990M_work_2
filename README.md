# GEOG5990-zikang_ji
This is the second part of the Python assessment.

# The list of file

1. agentframework.py        (the framework)
2. final.py                 (the main program) 

# Overview of the program

This is a simple program to estimate the location of the 'bacteria'. I used a suitable algorithm to simulate the possible trajectory of the bacteria and print out the map.

# Run mode

Press the Run file(F5) in final.py, there will be a density map in Spyder. It is a possible spread of bacteria. And there will generate a txt file in the root directory which is the density map in binary form.

# What should show in the program

There should be a environment as the background of the city, and a point as the bombing point. The map in the Spyder should show the possiable infected area by points.

# What more could show in the program

For now, there is no real user interface in this program, and there should be one. A console that can control variables would made this program more useful. I tried to do so, but it is kind of out my range for now.

# Difficulty

The calculating of the path of the becteria is the hard part of this program. I spend half a day to made it right. And there are mach more difficulty I can not remember, programming is a real time killer. I watched a lot of video about the way of thinking in Python. It is different from my other work, but I was enjoy it. Programming really expand my horizon.
